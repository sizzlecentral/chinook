Chinook Exercise / Part 1
-------------------------

Provide one or more Active Record queries that retrieve the
requested data for each of the following:

1. Find the albums recorded by the artist Queen.

  => Artist.find_by(name: 'Queen')
  => Album.where(artist_id: 51)

2. Count how many tracks belong to the media type
  "Protected MPEG-4 video file".

  => MediaType.find_by(name: 'Protected MPEG-4 video file')
  => Track.where(media_type_id: 3).count

3. Find the genre with the name "Hip Hop/Rap".

  => Genre.find_by(name: 'Hip Hop/Rap')

4. Count how many tracks belong to the "Hip Hop/Rap" genre

  => Track.where(genre_id: 17).count

5. Find the total amount of time required to listen to all the
  tracks in the database.

  => Track.sum("milliseconds")

6. Find the highest price of any track that has the media type
  "MPEG audio file".

  => MediaType.find_by(name: 'MPEG audio file')
  => Track.where(media_type_id: 1).maximum("unit_price")

7. Find the name of the most expensive track that has the media
  type "MPEG audio file".

  => Track.where(media_type_id: 1).order(unit_price: :desc).first.name

8. Find the 2 oldest artists.

  => Artist.order(created_at: :asc).limit(2)

9. Find the least expensive track that has the genre
  "Electronica/Dance".

    => Genre.find_by(name: 'Electronica/Dance')
    => Track.where(genre_id: 15).order(unit_price: :asc).first.name

10. Find all "MPEG audio file" tracks in the genre
  "Electronica/Dance".

  => Track.where(media_type_id: 1).where(genre_id: 15)


Stretch: More Active Record Query Interface
-------------------------------------------

1. Find all the albums whose titles start with B.

  => Album.where("title ILIKE ?", 'b%')

2. Find the all the artists whose names start with A.

  => Artist.where("name ILIKE ?", 'a%')


Stretch: Querying the Chinook Database using SQL
------------------------------------------------

1.  Find the albums recorded by the artist Queen.

  => SELECT id FROM artists WHERE name = 'Queen';
  => SELECT * FROM albums WHERE artist_id = 51;

2. Count how many tracks belong to the media type
  "Protected MPEG-4 video file".

  => SELECT Count(name) AS NumberOfTracks FROM media_types WHERE name = 'Protected MPEG-4 video file';

3. Find the least expensive track that has the genre
  "Electronica/Dance".

  => SELECT MIN(unit_price) FROM tracks WHERE genre_id = 15;

4. Find the all the artists whose names start with A.

  => SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name ILIKE 'a%';

5. Find all the tracks that belong to playlist 1.

  => SELECT * FROM playlists_tracks WHERE playlist_id = 1;
